# BiTexer
The *Nintendo DS* standard 3D model file format is BTX0 and it usually has a
section with the model texture called TEX0. If the dimensions of any of the
textures change, the 3D commands needs to be updated with the new values. This is
the purpouse of the tool.
> It searchs for any texture 3D command and update its values with the new
> dimensions.

The documentation about the file format has been taken from
[Tinke](https://github.com/pleonex/tinke/blob/master/Plugins/3DModels/3DModels/BMD0.cs) project.
